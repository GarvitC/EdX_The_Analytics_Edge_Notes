********************************** Unit-8: Linear Optimization ************************************

1. Optimization - Airline Example:
    - R: Regular seats; D: Discounted seats
    - Maximize Total revenue: (R Fare)*R + (D Fare)*D
        Subject to - Seats sold can't exceed capacity: R + D <= (Total Capacity)
                   - Seats sold can't be negative: R <= 0; D<=0
                   - Seats sold can't exceed demand: R <= (R Demand); D <= (D Demand)
    
2. Use Excel Solver - (MANAGE ADD-INS IF SOLVER NOT IN ANALYSIS TAB OF DATA)

3. Sensitivity Analysis: Understanding how the solution changes when data changes (like in case of changes in
    marketing decisions - Increase in marketing budget leads to increased demands, but in some cases the decrease
    in demand for a particular category of product may not affect the revenue; the marketing budget can be lowered
    in such cases)
    - Shadow Price: Marginal revenue gained by increasing the demand by one unit; if the shadow price for a 
        category is zero, it may not affect the revenue even if the demand decreases
    - For a category with higher marginal revenue, it is beneficial to increase the demands by altering the
        the marketing budget
    
4. Formulate the problem in form of a plot using the constraints and then use the curve to find the optimal
    solution and effects of changes during sensitivity analysis on the optimal solution

5. Google AdWords Recitation
    - Bids placed by advertisers for different queries in an auction
    - Price per click decided by Google for each advertiser and each query based on bids and quality score
        (fit of advertiser and ad to the queries)
    - Google then decides how often to display each ad for each query
    
6. According to the budget given by advertiser and the price per click (PPC - how much advertiser pays Google 
    when user clicks ad for that query) decided by Google, the budget is depleted by PPC amount on each click
    by user on that ad
    
7. CTR - Click Through Rate: Probability that a user clicks on the advertiser's ad (clicks per user), this is
    decided for one query and one advertiser e.g. for a CTR of 0.08 and 50 users, we will have 4 (50*0.08) users 
    clicking on the ad out of 50

8. Average Price per Display - Average amount that advertiser pays each time its ad is shown - PPC * CTR

9. Google has estimate of how many times a query will be requested in a given day

10. Problem: How may times to display each ad for each query to maximize revenue
    Objective: Maximize Revenue
    Constraints: 1) Average amount paid by each advertiser can't exceed the budget
                2) Total ads for given query can't exceed estimated number of requests for that query
                
11. Modelling: 1) Decision Variables - One for each advertiser and each query
                                        (No. of advertisers * No. of Queries)
               2) Revenue to Google - Average price per display * corresponding decision variable
               3) Constraints - Price paid by one advertiser < Budget of that advertiser
                              - For each query, sum of ads displayed < Estimated number of requests for that query
